                <h1>Our Thesis Arnis Training Dummy </h1>
                <p>ARNISENSE is a training dummy our thesis team built with sensors that track your Arnis strikes in real time. It detects impact and reads your form, then gives clear feedback after each session. It’s designed to help athletes train smarter and see their progress as they practice.</p>

                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>The idea started small, but everyone put in their own skills to bring it to life for the CvSU-Carmona Arnis athletes. I mostly worked on the hardware and sensor logic, but the project only came together because of the team’s effort. It’s far from perfect, but we’re proud of what we built and what we learned together.</p>

                <h1>The Problem We Tackled</h1>
                <p>When we started this project, we saw that Arnis practitioners struggle when training alone because there’s no instant feedback to tell them if their strikes are accurate, strong, or done with the right form. Static dummies and partner drills only help so much—they don’t show mistakes, and they don’t track performance. So as a team, we challenged ourselves to build something smarter: a training dummy with sensors that can read impact, movement, and technique in real time. Our goal was simple—give athletes clear, immediate feedback so they can correct themselves while they practice.</p>

                <h1>How We Did It</h1>
                <p>Our team started by planning the layout of the dummy, the types of sensors we needed, and how we’d connect everything. From there, we built the dummy frame, wired the push-button hit sensors, and assembled the wearable module with the MPU-6050, vibration motor, HC-05 Bluetooth, and Arduino Nano. On the software side, we set up the data processing logic, added DTW for movement matching, and programmed the feedback system using LEDs, vibration cues, and the Raspberry Pi kiosk display. We spent a lot of time testing strikes, adjusting sensor placement, fixing inconsistencies, and refining the feedback until everything worked smoothly together.</p>

                <h1>System Features</h1>
                <p>ARNISENSE uses a simple but effective setup to track both strikes and movement. The dummy has momentary push-button hit sensors and LED strips that light up as visual cues whenever a strike lands. For motion tracking, the wearable module is built with an MPU-6050 IMU, a vibration motor for haptic feedback, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, and an Arduino Nano that sends data wirelessly to a Raspberry Pi on a kiosk-style touch-screen LCD station. The system uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compare the user’s movements with reference patterns, allowing it to detect technique accuracy more precisely. All of these work together to read impact, analyze motion, and give instant feedback to the athlete in real time.</p>
